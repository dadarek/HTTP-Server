- Add strict compiler flags

- Merge common headers together
- Do explicit destructors (virtual and non-virtual)
      implicitly call the base destructor?

- Give better names to test functions (i.e. ThrowsExceptionWhenBindReturnsError

- Separate out SocketApi into SocketIOApi and SocketConnectionAPI?  Maybe?

- FileReader should probably return char[] instead of string
- Change makefile so that main depends on everything
- Can I get rid of redundant test cases? (check if read, etc)

- Make sure SOMEBODY closes the client socket - probably server after delegatin to connection handler (write tests for this).

- Make sure that any objects passed into HttpConnectionHandler (which will
  probably be a thread) are ALL STATELESS!!!

- It is not tested if HttpResponse allocates or deletes the correct size buffer
- Make sure that users of SystemFileReader delete returned to char*;
- make sure that SystemFileReader delete allocated array if read fails
- If SystemFileReader file->read() returns -1, throw exception and DELETE BUFFER AND FILE*
- SystemFileReader should not return string but char*

- Maybe use Abstract Factory (for SocketApi, FileApi, and all others that have a Mock and corresponding Real object )

- FileApi should not have extension Api because it does more than just
--- relay calls to system calls.  (SocketApi strictly relays calls to 
--- system calls, nothing more.)  Change one of these extensions.

- rename HttpRequestFilehandler to HttpFileRequestHandler

- get rid of dynamic casts in tests???

- add an "UNKNOWN RESPONSE" handler that simply echos back the request

- Figure out Memory Checking in GTest

- use ASSERT_STREQ instead of ASSERT_EQ
