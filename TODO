- Add strict compiler flags

- Merge common headers together
- Do explicit destructors (virtual and non-virtual)
      implicitly call the base destructor?

- Give better names to test functions (i.e. ThrowsExceptionWhenBindReturnsError

- Separate out SocketApi into SocketIOApi and SocketConnectionAPI?  Maybe?

- FileReader should probably return char[] instead of string
- Change makefile so that main depends on everything
- Can I get rid of redundant test cases? (check if read, etc)

- Look at SocketReader::READ_EXCEPTION
- Look at SocketApi::SOCKET_EXCEPTION, BIND_EXCEPTION, ACCEPT_EXCEPTION

- Make sure SOMEBODY closes the client socket - probably server after delegatin to connection handler (write tests for this).

- Make sure that any objects passed into HttpConnectionHandler (which will
  probably be a thread) are ALL STATELESS!!!

- It is not tested if HttpResponse allocates or deletes the correct size buffer
- Make sure that users of SystemFileReader delete returned to char*;
- make sure that SystemFileReader delete allocated array if read fails
- If SystemFileReader file->read() returns -1, throw exception and DELETE BUFFER AND FILE*
- SystemFileReader should not return string but char*

- Maybe use Abstract Factory (for SocketApi, FileApi, and all others that have a Mock and corresponding Real object )
